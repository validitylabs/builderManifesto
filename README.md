# Manifesto for a Decentralised Technology Association

We are builders of decentralised protocols, products and tools who believe in an open, trustless, democratic and decentralised internet. 

We believe that our values, voices and perspectives are not heard by, or reflected by, the existing associations that claim to represent blockchain and decentralized technology companies, foundations and other organisations in and around Switzerland.

In reflection of this we will establish a new Decentralised Association, compliant with the legal requirements of an Association under Swiss law, to act as the voice of the decentralised technology builders in and around Switzerland. 

The association will be open to individual and company members who are building decentralised and Web3 technologies, irrespective of individual platform or blockchain.
